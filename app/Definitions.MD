### Definitions and Explanatory Notes

**Reference Week**  

Monthly estimates of employment, unemployment, and persons not in the labour force refer to the specific week covered by the survey each month,
normally the week containing the 15th day.  

**Labour Force**  

The labour force is composed of those members of the civilian non-institutional population 15 years of age and over who, during the reference week,
were employed or unemployed.  

**Employed**  

Employed persons are those who, during the reference week, either:  

1. did any work at all, or  
2. had a job but were not at work due to own illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, bad weather, labour dispute, vacation, or other reason not specified above (excluding persons whose job attachment was to a job to start at a definite date in the future).  

**Unemployment**  

Unemployed persons are those who, during the reference week, either:  

1. were without work, had actively looked for work in the past four weeks (ending with the reference week), and were available for work; or  
2. had not actively looked for work in the past four weeks but had been on layoff and were available for work; or  
3. had not actively looked for work in the past four weeks but had a new job to start in four weeks or less from the reference week, and were available for work.  

**Unemployment Rate**  

The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed persons expressed as a percentage of the labour force. The unemployment rate for a
particular group (age, sex, marital status, etc.) is the number of unemployed in that group expressed as a percentage of the labour force for that group.  

**Participation Rate**  

The participation rate represents the labour force expressed as a percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The participation rate
for a particular group (age, sex, marital status, etc.) is the labour force for that group expressed as a percentage of the population for that group.  
 
**Employment Rate**  

The employment rate (employment/population ratio) is the number of employed persons expressed as a percentage of the population 15 years of age
and over. The employment rate for a particular group (age, sex, marital status, etc.) is the employment for that group expressed as a percentage
of the population for that group.  

**Rounding**  

Estimates published by the Labour Force Survey are rounded to the nearest thousand but all derived values (totals, averages, rates, ratios, percent
changes etc.) are calculated from unrounded figures. Therefore, the sum of the individual rounded items may not equal the total.  

**Seasonal Adjustment (S.A.)**  

Fluctuations in economic time series are caused by seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which
seasonal movements have been eliminated. Seasonal movements are defined as those which are caused by regular annual events such as
climate, holidays, vacation periods, and cycles related to crops, production and retail sales associated with Christmas and Easter. It should be
noted that the seasonally adjusted series contain irregular as well as longer-term cyclical fluctuations.
